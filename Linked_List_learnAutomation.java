 * addFirst(),addLast(),getFirst(),get(),removeFirst(),removeLast(),
 * poll() to delete the first element in the list ,poolLast()
 * removeFirstoccurence() to remove the 2 means [1,2,3,4,5,6,2,7] >>> output[1,3,4,5,,2,7]

 *      stack:
 *      
 *      The stack is a linear data structure that is used to store the collection of objects. 
 *      It is based on Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). Java collection framework provides many interfaces and 
 *      classes to store the collection of objects. One of them is the Stack class that provides different operations 
 *      such as ((push to add , pop to remove , peek() to get the first element ,search()
