// [ Dynamic polymorphism ] in Java occurs at [ runtime ]via method overriding and inheritance

 /*
   1.overriding:  parent and child class contains function with similar name
   2.child class is override the parent class when the object is created for the child class
[imp] 3.type is parent class and object is child class() [ here which method called
      depend on the object method ] this is called upcasting
      4.method with initialize with the final buzz word we can not able to override
      5.can we override static method ?
      [no ,why because their  not depended on anyone]

  [INTERNAL WORKING OF METHOD OVERRIDING]
         * dynamic method dispatch ( when  java predict which function to run? )
          [ run-time ]
