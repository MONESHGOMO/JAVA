Advantages of Collection over array
- collection :
    - Dynamic Size 
    - Algorithms for data manipulations
    - Single API
    - can work only with references types
    - relatively lower performance
- Array
    - Fixed size
    - No any behavior
    - No single API
    - can work with reference and primitive types
    - Higher performance
    - No. of algorithm in Array is lesser when compared to Collection
