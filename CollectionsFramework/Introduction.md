# Java Collections Framework

## Difference Between `Collection` and `Collections`
| Feature        | Collection | Collections |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Type         | Interface  | Utility Class |
| Purpose      | Defines a group of objects | Provides static methods for collection operations |
| Example      | `List`, `Set`, `Queue` | `Collections.sort()`, `Collections.shuffle()` |

## Relationship Between `Collection` and `Collections`
The `Collection` interface and `Collections` class are related but serve different purposes in Java:

1. **`Collection` Interface**:  
   - It is the root interface of the Java Collections Framework.
   - It provides the basic structure for different types of collections like `List`, `Set`, and `Queue`.
   - Example: `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, and `LinkedList` all implement the `Collection` interface.

2. **`Collections` Class**:  
   - It is a utility class that contains static methods for performing operations on collections.
   - It provides methods like `sort()`, `reverse()`, `shuffle()`, and `binarySearch()`, which can be used on objects that implement the `Collection` interface.
   - Example: `Collections.sort(list)` sorts a `List` that implements `Collection`.

### Relationship:
- The `Collection` interface defines the structure of collection objects, while the `Collections` class provides useful methods to operate on them.
- Without `Collection`, there would be no standard way to store and manipulate groups of objects. The `Collections` class enhances this functionality by adding useful utilities.

## What is the Collections Framework?
The **Collections Framework** in Java is a set of classes and interfaces that provide a unified architecture for storing, manipulating, and retrieving groups of objects. It is designed to handle dynamic data structures efficiently.

### The Collections Framework is divided into three main parts:
1. **Classes**: Implementations of various collection types (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`).
2. **Interfaces**: Defines standard collection types (e.g., `List`, `Set`, `Map`).
3. **Utility Classes**: Provides helper methods for common operations (e.g., `Collections` class for sorting and searching).

## Why Use the Collections Framework?
Unlike arrays, collections are **dynamic in size**, meaning they can grow or shrink as needed. Collections also provide:
- **Versatile Data Management**: Allows adding, removing, and retrieving elements efficiently.
- **Built-in Algorithms**: Enables sorting, searching, and manipulation of data with ease.
- **Pre-built Utility Methods**: The `Collections` class provides common operations like searching, sorting, and iterating over elements.

## When to Use the Collections Framework?
Use collections when your application deals with data that changes frequently (e.g., adding or removing elements). Below are some common use cases:

- **Storing a list of usernames** → Use `ArrayList`.
- **Creating a phone directory** → Use `HashMap`.
- **Maintaining unique user IDs** → Use `HashSet`.

---

## Code Examples
### 1. Storing a list of usernames using `ArrayList`
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class UserList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> usernames = new ArrayList<>();
        usernames.add("Alice");
        usernames.add("Bob");
        usernames.add("Charlie");

        System.out.println("Usernames: " + usernames);
    }
}
```

### 2. Creating a phone directory using `HashMap`
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class PhoneDirectory {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, String> phoneBook = new HashMap<>();
        phoneBook.put("Alice", "123-456-7890");
        phoneBook.put("Bob", "987-654-3210");
        phoneBook.put("Charlie", "555-666-7777");
        
        System.out.println("Phone Directory: " + phoneBook);
    }
}
```

### 3. Maintaining unique user IDs using `HashSet`
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class UniqueUserIDs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet<Integer> userIds = new HashSet<>();
        userIds.add(101);
        userIds.add(102);
        userIds.add(103);
        userIds.add(101); // Duplicate, will not be added
        
        System.out.println("Unique User IDs: " + userIds);
    }
}
```

Using the **Collections Framework** simplifies data management, making Java applications more efficient and easier to maintain.
