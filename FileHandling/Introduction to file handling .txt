Streams: (Abstraction that java provides)
    It is a sequence of data and  it can be two types of data 
    1.Byte (image)
    2.Character(uni code characters)
    [imp]: Streams are connected to our input system
    3.Java implements these within th classes of java.io packages 

    
    Byte Stream :(ectends InputStreams or OutputStreams)

    METHODS AVAILABLA : Read()
        two types [ InputStream & OutputStream ]
         
         FileInputStream
            [FileInputStream]
                Reads data from files.
            [ByteArrayInputStream]
                Reads data from a byte array.
            [BufferedInputStream]
                 buffering to an input stream for improved performance.
            [DataInputStream]
                Reads primitive data types (e.g., int, float, boolean).
            [PipedInputStream]
                Reads data from a PipedOutputStream (used for inter-thread communication).
            [ObjectInputStream]
                Reads serialized objects from an input stream.
            [FilterInputStream]
                Wrapper for other input streams, used for adding functionality.
            [SequenceInputStream]
                Concatenates multiple input streams and reads them sequentially.
            [PushbackInputStream]
                Allows a byte to be pushed back into the stream for re-reading.


[InputStreamReader] : use to convert streams into character streams ,they read the byte data and decode thst by using charset()
[IO Exception]:
             example: file not found, file can't able to read 


    Character Stream:
        two types [Reader & Writer ]










Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.in is a standard input stream (class) in Java.
         It is typically used to read input from the keyboard. Here are some key points about System.in:

        Key Points:
            Type: System.in is an instance of InputStream.
            Purpose: It is used to read byte data from standard input (usually the keyboard).            
            Usage: Often used with classes like Scanner, BufferedReader, or InputStreamReader to read user input in a more manageable format.
        Predefined-Streams :
            Standard output stream ( Console ) -> System.out  | PrintStream |
            Standard input stream ( Keyword ) -> System.in    | InputStream |
            Standard error  stream ( Console ) -> System.err  | PrintStream | .. they all are belongs to byte stream
