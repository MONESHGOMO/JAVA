## Basic Java Concepts:

1. **What is Java?**
   - Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device that has the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. It is widely used for building applications ranging from web applications to mobile apps and enterprise systems.

2. **What are the key features of Java?**
   - Key features include:
     - **Platform Independence**: Java is platform-independent due to its bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
     - **Object-Oriented**: Java supports concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
     - **Robust**: Java provides strong memory management and exception handling.
     - **Multithreading**: Java supports multithreading for concurrent execution of tasks.
     - **Security**: Java provides a secure environment for applications.

3. **What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?**
   - **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: It includes tools necessary for developing Java applications, such as the compiler, debugger, and the JRE.
   - **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: It provides the environment for running Java applications. It includes JVM and standard Java libraries.
   - **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: It is responsible for interpreting and executing Java bytecode.

4. **What is the difference between `==` and `equals()` in Java?**
   - `==` checks for reference equality (i.e., whether two references point to the same object in memory).
   - `equals()` checks for logical equality (i.e., whether two objects are logically equivalent, usually overridden in the `Object` class).

5. **What are the access modifiers in Java?**
   - **public**: Accessible from any other class.
   - **private**: Accessible only within the same class.
   - **protected**: Accessible within the same package or subclasses.
   - **default**: Accessible only within the same package.

6. **What is a class and an object in Java?**
   - A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and behaviors (methods).
   - An **object** is an instance of a class, representing real-world entities.

7. **What is the purpose of the `main()` method in Java?**
   - The `main()` method is the entry point for Java applications. When the program is executed, the JVM calls the `main()` method.

8. **What is a constructor in Java?**
   - A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the object's state. Constructors can be parameterized or default (no arguments).

9. **What is the difference between a constructor and a method?**
   - A **constructor** is used to initialize an object when it is created. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.
   - A **method** is a block of code that performs a specific task and may or may not return a value.

10. **What are primitive data types in Java?**
    - Primitive data types are the most basic types of data. These include:
      - `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts:

1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**
   - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which contain data (attributes) and methods (behaviors). The four main principles of OOP are:
     - **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class).
     - **Inheritance**: The ability of a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
     - **Polymorphism**: The ability to take multiple forms (method overloading and method overriding).
     - **Abstraction**: Hiding the complexity and exposing only the essential features of an object.

2. **What is inheritance in Java?**
   - Inheritance allows a class to inherit fields and methods from another class. The class that inherits is called a **subclass**, and the class being inherited from is called the **superclass**.

3. **What is polymorphism in Java?**
   - Polymorphism allows one method or object to behave in multiple ways. There are two types:
     - **Method Overloading**: Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
     - **Method Overriding**: Subclass providing a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass.

4. **What is encapsulation in Java?**
   - Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit called a class. It helps in hiding the internal implementation details and protecting the data from unauthorized access.

5. **What is abstraction in Java?**
   - Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities. It can be achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

6. **What is an interface in Java?**
   - An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods without providing their implementation. A class that implements the interface must provide concrete implementations for all the methods in the interface.

7. **What is method overloading and method overriding?**
   - **Method Overloading**: Occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
   - **Method Overriding**: Occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass.

## Java Fundamentals:

1. **What is the difference between `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer`?**
   - **String**: Immutable, meaning once created, the value cannot be changed.
   - **StringBuilder**: Mutable and thread-unsafe, suitable for single-threaded environments.
   - **StringBuffer**: Mutable and thread-safe, suitable for multi-threaded environments.

2. **What are arrays in Java?**
   - Arrays in Java are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are fixed in size and can store elements of the same type.

3. **What is the `final` keyword in Java?**
   - The `final` keyword is used to define constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance of classes.

4. **What is a static variable and method in Java?**
   - **Static Variable**: A variable shared by all instances of a class.
   - **Static Method**: A method that can be called without creating an instance of the class.

5. **What is the `this` keyword in Java?**
   - `this` refers to the current instance of a class and is used to access instance variables and methods.

6. **What is a `super` keyword in Java?**
   - `super` is used to refer to the parent class and can be used to access parent class members.

7. **What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?**
   - **ArrayList**: Uses a dynamic array to store elements, provides fast access but slower insertion and deletion.
   - **LinkedList**: Uses a doubly linked list to store elements, provides fast insertion and deletion but slower access.

8. **What is the difference between `HashMap` and `TreeMap`?**
   - **HashMap**: Stores key-value pairs with no specific order, provides fast access.
   - **TreeMap**: Stores key-value pairs in a sorted order based on keys.

## Exception Handling:

1. **What is an exception in Java?**
   - An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. Exceptions are classified into **checked exceptions** (which must be handled) and **unchecked exceptions** (which do not need to be handled explicitly).

2. **What is the difference between `throw` and `throws` in Java?**
   - **throw** is used to explicitly throw an exception.
   - **throws** is used to declare exceptions that a method might throw.

3. **What is a `try-catch` block in Java?**
   - A `try-catch` block is used to handle exceptions. The code that might throw an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and the handling of that exception is done inside the `catch` block.

4. **What is the `finally` block in Java?**
   - The `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is used for cleanup operations like closing file streams or database connections.

5. **What is the difference between `RuntimeException` and `Exception`?**
   - `RuntimeException` is an unchecked exception, while `Exception` is a checked exception. Unchecked exceptions do not require explicit handling.

## Java Collections:

1. **What is the Java Collections Framework?**
   - The Java Collections Framework provides a set of interfaces and classes for storing and manipulating groups of data, such as `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and `Queue`.

2. **What is the difference between `List`, `Set`, and `Map` in Java?**
   - **List**: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements (e.g., `ArrayList`).
   - **Set**: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements (e.g., `HashSet`).
   - **Map**: A collection that stores key-value pairs (e.g., `HashMap`).

3. **What is a `HashSet` and how does it differ from a `TreeSet`?**
   - **HashSet**: Stores elements in an unordered way with no duplicates.
   - **TreeSet**: Stores elements in a sorted order and does
  
### Difference Between List, Set, and Map in Java Collections Framework

| **Feature**               | **List**                            | **Set**                              | **Map**                                  |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**             | An ordered collection of elements, allows duplicates. | A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. | A collection that stores key-value pairs. |
| **Duplicates**             | Allows duplicates.                 | Does not allow duplicates.           | Allows unique keys, but values can be duplicated. |
| **Order**                  | Elements are ordered.              | No guaranteed order (unless using `TreeSet`). | Keys are ordered based on the implementation (e.g., `HashMap` is unordered, `TreeMap` is sorted). |
| **Null Elements**          | Allows null elements.            | Allows null elements (except in `TreeSet`). | Allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values (in `HashMap`). |
| **Implementation Classes** | `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`. | `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`. | `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `Hashtable`. |
| **Access Type**            | Indexed access by position.        | Unordered, no indexed access.       | Accessed by keys (not by index). |
| **Thread-Safety**          | Not thread-safe (unless using `Vector` or `CopyOnWriteArrayList`). | Not thread-safe.                    | Not thread-safe (unless using `ConcurrentHashMap`). |
| **Performance**            | Fast random access, slower insertion/removal (in `ArrayList`). | Fast for checking existence of elements. | Fast lookups by key, slower insertion/removal (for `TreeMap`). |
| **Use Case**               | Storing ordered elements where duplicates are allowed (e.g., storing a list of names). | Storing unique elements (e.g., a set of unique users). | Storing key-value pairs (e.g., a dictionary, or mapping a name to an address). |
